The Public Safety Common Operational Picture (COP) application offers a standard overview of an incident,
providing incident information that enables the Incident Commander/Unified Command and any supporting
agencies and organizations to make effective, consistent, and timely decisions. It is a configuration of
ArcGIS Viewer for Flex that can be used by emergency management staff in an Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
